          I'm a front end developer with 3+ years of experience and I've worked
          on different projects from a landing page to a ticket system similar
          to TicketMaster or a Word file viewer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I always liked art or at least some of it, I think art can be found
          everywhere, it's just a matter of looking closely ðŸ‘€...
          <br />
          But the technology had its point, it was incredible to know how these
          machines with a screen could amuse us and help us in so many daily
          tasks. For me, this is being
          <span class="text-green-500 inline">Front-End</span>, combining
          <span class="text-pink-500 inline">Art</span> and
          <span class="text-blue-500 inline">Technology</span>.

          Long? Maybe
          <br />
          Fun? Absolutely sure
          <!-- I have always liked everything related to the world of art and
          programming, after finishing university I decided to put these two
          universes together.

          For more than two years I have been increasing my knowledge to offer
          people a work well done, with current technology and innovative
          designs.
          <br />
          <br />
          I worked for a digital agency where I developed a ticketing platform,
          an online store and a CRM system, all this developed with VueJS.
